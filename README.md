## Hello, I'm a programmer..

Hi, my name is Petr Chalupa and I come from the Czech Republic. Programming is both my hobby and my field of education. I've been doing it for over 5 years and I'm
constantly trying to improve by working on different projects. I have the most experience with websites and web applications, both on frontend and on backend.
