## Hello, I'm a programmer..

**Hi,** I'm Petr Chalupa, programmer from the Czech Republic. Programming is both my hobby and my field of education. I'm constantly trying to improve myself by working on different
projects, including frontend & backend of web applications or programming simple hardware. You can find my contacts below and get in touch with me (I can provide CV upon request).
