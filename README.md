### Hello, I'm a programmer..

Hi, my name is Petr Chalupa and I come from the Czech Republic. Programming is both my hobby and my field of education. I have been doing it for over 5 years and I am
constantly trying to improve by working on different projects. I have the most experience with websites and web applications, both on the frontend and on the backend. You can
download my CV below or you can contact me directly via email, which can also be found below.
